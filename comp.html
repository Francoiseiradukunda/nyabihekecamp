<div class="completeness"> 
    <div class="login-page">
        <h1 class="login">Login page</h1>
        I have knowledge to design well login page where none can access <br>you data without 
        autheticate,Where you are allowed to access a data with login for your account <br>
        in other word you must have an account before you access the data otherwise you can't access it.

    </div>
    
<div class="index-page">
    <h1 class="index">Index page</h1>
    Okey, ihave skills for developing an index page where is inside between login pages and logout pages. <br>
    where you can do login to access data from index pages and other pages. <br>
    and whereas you can do the logout to prevent sameone who can access your data without permission. <br>
    an index page is so very imprtant pages becouse it is most very important in hosting. <br>
    without index without host your website.   
</div> 
<div class="logout-page">
  <h1 class="logout"> Logout page </h1>
      OK let us continue to the logout page, this page is used as to close your opened <br>
      door, becouse when work logout nobody can access your data without authetication. <br>
      when you do logout you can do logout your protect your data well.

    <h3>Coascoding Style Sheet(CSS)</h3>
   <p> css is the style sheet becaouse is used to style page, this is worked in three ways <br>
    like Inline css:where you use a css with aplying a css element on single line of codes. <br>
    Internal css:this is used whes you open a css tag on single html element and you aplly an css you want. <br>
    External css:This css is so very clearly and is better to use it, becouse you can write any number line <br>
    of wanted codes,and is accessed when apoening link tags in the head section of pages, <br>
    and you links-on page have extantion with css. </p><br>
